= Personal Tips & Tricks

My working environment is mostly CentOS 7. Thus, unless specified otherwise, it
can be assumed that the commands are to be run on this OS.

== OpenSSH - Generating Keys

Generating authentication keys for OpenSSH:

----
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C <hostname>
----

== Sysstat - pidstat timestamp

This issue occurred on 7.9.2009 with sysstat 10.1.5-20.el7_9. `pidstat`
printed the opening timestamp in a different format depending on the logged-in
user:

Sample 1 (memory value is at position 8):

----
05:29:05 AM     0      7144 224393.65      0.00 4629044 1943848   1.97  app
----

Sample 2 (memory value is at position 7):

----
04:14:22        0     34658 210790.37      0.00 4786596 2050684   2.08  app
----

We were not able to resolve by using the `S_TIME_FORMAT` environment variable.
We resolved it by using the `-h` switch that made `pidstat` print the
timestamp in seconds since Epoch.

== AsciiDoc - PDF

Install the packages necessary to convert AsciiDoc (usually `.adoc` file
extension) file to PDF:

----
$  sudo yum install asciidoc dblatex
----

A command-line that I have used:

----
$ a2x --icons-dir /usr/share/asciidoc/images -f pdf  \
 --dblatex-opts "-P doc.publisher.show=0 -P latex.output.revhistory=0 \
 -Pdoc.layout=\"coverpage frontmatter mainmatter index \"" \
 --doctype=article README.adoc
----

This is useful when the table of contents needs to be disabled. Otherwise, the
`-Pdoc.layout` switch is not required.

== AsciiDoc - Relative Links

To generate hyperlinks to a file inside a Git repo use the `link` macro
(https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/link-macro/[source]).
Example:

----
link:path/to/file.pdf[file.pdf]
----

== Markdown - Generate Table of Contents

https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc[Doctoc] can be used to generate table of
contents in markdown files. Essentially:

----
$ sudo npm install -g doctoc
----

The table of contents of this file has been generated using `doctoc`:

----
$ doctoc Tips.md
----

== Markdown - CLI Preview

https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow[Glow] makes it possible to preview
Markdown files on the terminal. Download an install a suitable binary package
from the https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow/releases[releases page]

== Markdown - Table Genrator

The https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables[tables generator]
site can be used to generate markdown for tables.

== Vim - Installing Vim 8 on CentOS 7

It is always easiest to install from binary packages (than compiling from
source). Vim 8 is available from the GhettoForge Plus repo. Install it:

----
$ sudo yum install
https://mirror.ghettoforge.org/distributions/gf/gf-release-latest.gf.el7.noarch.rpm
----

The repo has to be manually enabled:

----
$ sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/gf.repo
----

The package conflicts with the one coming from base CentOS and so has to be
removed. Do keep a backup of `sudo` config (e.g. `/etc/sudoers`) because it
gets removed in the process:

----
$ sudo yum autoremove vim-minimal
$ sudo yum install vim-enhanced sudo
----

== Vim - Building Vim 8 on CentOS 7

The main reason why I wanted to upgrade to Vim 8 on CentOS 7 was the
https://github.com/fatih/vim-go[vim-go] plugin. It did not find the version
that came from GhettoForge new enough and kept complaining. Therefore, I had to
resort to compiling from sources:

----
$ sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
$ sudo yum install ncurses ncurses-devel

----

As of this writing the tip of the master branch was `4b4b1b8` tagged as
`v8.2.3426`.

----
$ git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
$ cd vim
$ ./configure --with-features=huge \
    --enable-multibyte \
    --enable-rubyinterp \
    --enable-pythoninterp \
    --enable-luainterp \
    --prefix=/usr/local/vim8
----

Enabling Perl did not work for me. The compilation failed with an "Unrecognized
switch: -rototypes" error message. So, I had to drop it.

----
sudo mkdir /usr/local/vim8
sudo chown osboxes:osboxes /usr/local/vim8
----

Finally, compile and install:

----
$ make
$ make install
----

Notice how the install step was run as non-root. This ensures that we don't
modify system-wide locations any more than expected. If uninstallation is
required, then removing this one directory is enough.

----
$ sudo yum autoremove vim-enhanced
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/vim8/bin/vim /usr/local/bin/
----

== Go - Setting up Vim

After installing Vim 8, just do:

----
git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go
----

Commits that have worked in the past:

- **2024-01-14** Go 1.18.10 (https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/commit/e2e7ad7c[commit])
- **2023-06-21** Go 1.18.10 (https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/commit/397a9c57[commit])
- **2023-05-29** Go 1.18.10 (https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/commit/2a874910[commit])

That's it! For details see https://tpaschalis.github.io/vim-go-setup/[this] blog.

== Go - Directory Layout

I have kind of started liking the Go Project
https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout[layout].

== Go - Private Repository

Using a private repository in a Go involves the execution of multiple steps.
One, tell Git to use alternative SSH protocol to make `go get` commands work:

----
$ git config --global url."git@gitlab.mycompany.com:".insteadOf "https://gitlab.mycompany.com/"
----

TWO, tell Go do disable validating certain modules:

----
$ go env -w GOPRIVATE=gitlab.mycompany.com
----

Do, `go help private` for more information.

THREE, ensure that the package's module uses the `.git` extension in its `go.mod`:

----
module gitlab.mycompany.com/group/subgroup/playground.git
----

FOUR, include the `.git` extension in the `import` declaration. Example:

== C/C++ - Reformat

https://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html[Astyle] can be used to ensure
consistent code indentation and formatting. The following works on Ubuntu
22.04:

----
sudo apt-get install astyle
----

Example command-line

----
LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" astyle -q -R --style=java -H '*.java' '*.c' '*.cc' '*.cpp' '*.h'
----

== C/C++ - Core Dumps

Enabling core dumps depends on kernel (Linux) settings. Configuration
that worked for me on Oracle Linux 9:

----
$ echo "/var/dumps/core.%e.%p" | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
----

The directory mentioned in `core_pattern`
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt[doc]) must exist.

----
$ sudo mkdir /var/dumps
----

Besides, the shell's resource limit for core files might have to be changed:

----
$ ulimit -c unlimited
----

== C/C++ - Detecting Memory Errors

AddressSanitizer was added to GCC in the
https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/changes.html[4.8] release. To use on Oracle Linux
9, an additional package has to be installed apart from `gcc`.

----
$ sudo yum install libasan.x86_64
----

Example program with a memory leak
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47201087/gcc-how-to-use-address-sanitizer[source]):

----
int main()
{
  int *prt = new int;
  return 0;
}
----

Let us say it is saved in a file named `main.cc`. To compile with the address
sanitizer enabled, do:

----
$ g++ -g -O0 -fsanitize=address main.cc
----

Running the generated executable would report the error along with the source
line number.

== Git - Git 2 on CentOS 7

Installing the newer Git 2 on CentOS 7 is required to avoid `git fetch-pack`
errors (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38373[38373]). First, uninstall
Git coming from base CentOS:

----
$ sudo yum erase git perl-Git
----

Then, install the Inline with Upstream Stable (https://ius.io/[IUS]) Yum
repository:

----
$ yum install \
  https://repo.ius.io/ius-release-el7.rpm \
  https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
----

Install Git 2:

----
$ sudo yum install git222
----

== Git - Email id per Repo

Sometimes there is a need to use separate author emails IDs in Git commits
residing in differente repos (e.g.  work and personal). To setup an email ID
specific to a repo, change directory to it and then run:

----
$ git config user.email "own_email@domain"
----

== Git - Renaming branches

----
$ git branch -m main master
$ git push -u origin master
$ git push origin --delete main
----

== Python - Pip on Python 2.7

To install a newer version of Pip on CentOS 7 than the one coming with the
distribution, do:

----
$ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py
$ python get-pip.py
----

This helped me get Pip 20.3.4.

== Python - requirements.txt

Dependencies of a Python codebase are often specified in a `requirements.txt`
file. An automated way to create this file is through the use of
https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs[pipreqs] that can be installed on Ubuntu 22.04
by running the following commands:

----
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install pipreqs
----

Oracle Linux 9 users can do:

----
sudo yum install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install pipreqs
----

Example usage:

----
cd path/to/project
pipreqs .
----

Some readers might have noticed that I wrote `pip3` instead of `pip`.
In environments that have only one from Python 3 or Python 2 the command `pip`
is likely to refer to the correct Python installation. However, this might not
work in mixed systems that have both Python versions installed. Therefore, it
is appropriate to specifically write `pip3` when working with Python 3
packages and likewise for `pip` and Python 2.

== Shell - lftp

`lftp` is a useful command. The interaction with a FTP server is faster and
more Bash-like. It also has an option to download complete directory trees.
Install it by running:

----
$ sudo yum install lftp
----

The command reads login information from `/.netrc`. Example contents:

----
machine <hostname1> login <user1> password <pass1>
machine <hostname2>.login <user2> password <pass2>
----

Then logging to a server and directly switching to a directory
becomes very convenient:

----
$ lftp sftp://<user1>@<hostname1>/upload
----

== Shell - find

Sometimes I want to search for files that have been recently downloaded or
edited. This means finding files on the basis of last modification time. The
following command finds files modified within the last 100 days:

----
$ find . -type f -mtime -100
----

== CMake - Python

This tip is useful at the time of packaging a Python module. The directory
where modules should be copied differs between Linux distributions. It could
be `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages` on Ubuntu and
`/usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages` on a Fedora derived
distribution. CMake can auto-detect the value and make it available through a
variable. This can be done by:

----
find_package(Python3 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Interpreter Development)
----

Subsequently, the `Python3_SITEARCH` variable will containe the directory
path.

== Names - System Facts

A source of system related variable names that can be used in shell scripts is
in the CMake man page, `/etc/os-release`. Here is a list that I have
constructed after studying such sources:

- OS_NAME="Ubuntu"
- OS_NAME_PRETTY="Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS"
- OS_VERSION_ID="22.04.4" I don't want anything around release because it
  causes confusion with version.
- OS_VERSION_CODENAME="jammy"
- OS_ID="ubuntu"
- OS_ID_LIKE="debian"

== Locale

Few of my text files don't get correctly rendered unless the
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locale[locale] is set to
en_US.UTF-8. To display the currently set locale use the `locale` command. If
it is not set to en_US-UTF-8, then installing it on Oracle Linux 9 involves:

----
sudo yum install glibc-langpack-en.x86_64
sudo localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
----
