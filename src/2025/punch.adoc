This article contains my notes around a four wheeler. I have not made any
particular attempt to provide information in a logical manner or explain terms
before first use.

== Tata Punch

Why?

- Good visibility. Large front glasses.
- High sitting position. I find it better if the normal viewing position is
  towards the road and surroundings rather than towards the horizon. Another
  benefit of higher sitting position is that feels comfortable like sitting on
  a chair.
- Good headroom. Interestingly, Tata Nexon is larger but feels less spacious
  inside.
- Small size. Most of the driving will be in the city.
- Doors open wide. Easy to get in and get out.
- It makes many safety features like anti break locking system (ABS) and
  electronic breakforce distribution (EBD), corner stability control (CSC),
  electronic stability program (ESP), rear parking sensors and reverse parking
  camera available to the budget buyer.
- Popular. This is an indicator that it is delivering something that
  the society regards as important.
- Moderate (not flashy) interiors

- Passive entry passive start (PEPS) Passive entry is the functionality to
  open the car when the key is near and the door handle is touched. It is a
  convenience feature that might be particularly useful for women drivers who
  typically don't have pockets in their dresses. However, attackers can
  amplify the key signal from a distance. It will be useful to know if
  key-less entry can be disabled. Passive start is about starting the engine
  using a push button.

  that need to be kept at a lower temperature (e.g. chocolates).

  situations where a rapid lowering of the cabin temperature is desirable.
